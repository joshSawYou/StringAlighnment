        * Lessons Learned:
        With the Windows API there are tons fo functions usable. Some of which getting handle, getting console information, setting console position. All of which are useful
        when trying to center a string in the console. You can get the height (GetStdHandlefunction) and width of the console (found as part of the GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo funciton),
        calculate width of the user's input, calculate the padding needed to be able to center the string, set the cursor position to beginning of pad (SetConsoleCursorPosition funtion).
